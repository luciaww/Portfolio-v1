        <!-- OVERVIEW -->
        <section>
            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>During my Charter Communications internship I was tasked with jumpstarting the motion guidelines for Kite, their design system. There had not been an extensive amount of work completed to create a more cohesive motion experience across platforms.</p>
            
            <p>Over the course of the 10 weeks, I worked closely with the design systems, design system technology, and accessibility teams to build my project.</p>

            <h2>Project Brief</h2>
            <p>Kite's motion guidelines had a lot of potential for growth and increased consistency.</p>

            <p>I was asked to <b>start building the foundations of Kite's motion guidelines.</b> These guidelines would be, like the rest of Kite, used across platforms and devices.</p>

            </span>
        </section>

        <!-- RESEARCH -->
        <section>
            <h1>Conducting Research about Kite & Motion</h1>
            <p>The documents that did exist regarding motion included: a audit of existing motion across Charter platforms created a few months prior, and a few documents with links to other design systems with motion guidelines.</p>
            <p>After reading through the audit, I took my time to do the following:</p><b>
            <ol>
                <li>gain a higher comprehension of Kite</li>
                <li>better understand motion</li>
                <li>read other design system motion documentations</li>
            </ol></b>
            <p>To better comprehend Kite, I read through the existing documentation on Kite's website and peeked at the component libraries in Abstract. I also played around with various Charter interfaces such as the mobile billing app, the website, the desktop TV app, etc.</p>

        <!-- ANALYSIS -->
        <section>
            <h1>Main Takeaways from Readings</h1>
            <h2>The principles of motion design</h2>
            <p>One of the most important things that I learned, was that motion should have purpose. And the three main purposes that this encompassed were:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>going against change blindness</li>
                <li>improve perceived performance of systems</li>
                <li>create increased willingness to wait</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In order to accomplish these, motion should be informative, focused, and expressive.</p>
            <h2>How and when to use motion</h2>
            <p>Motion, just like the other aspects of a design system, should be consistent and tie in with product values, and voice and tone. </p>
            <p>Charter puts a strong emphasis on building accessible systems for its users. There are aspects of motion that may not be accessibility friendly. WCAG and low-motion options in browsers exist to promote a11y-friendly interfaces.</p>
            <h2>The current state of Charter's motion</h2>
            <p>As mentioned before, the audit revealed that there were currently no consistent usage of motion across products.</p>
            <p>Different teams valued motion different amounts. For instance, mobile teams heavily valued microinteractions, whereas teams working on 10-foot experiences (e.g. television) did not view motion to be as crucial to the user experience because users were further away from the screen, and certain TV resolutions would not properly support motions.</p>
            <p>Some product teams had far more support and already built-in motion. Enterprise and Spectrum TV App teams, for example, had well documented articles on their motion usage.</p>
            <p>There was preference for different motion prototyping tools across the different teams as well.</p>
            <p></p>

        <!-- PLANNING -->
        <section>
            <h1>Planning the Future</h1>
            <p>For my end product, I wanted to have 1) examples of the animations I created (either in use, or just abstract demonstrations of them), and 2) a rough draft of the guidelines.</p>

            <p>The guidelines would be viewed by not only designers, so I wanted to make sure they were well understood by everyone. By providing examples of what kinds of animations to use, or to avoid, users would better understand when it was appropriate or inappropriate to use certain motion types.</p>

            <p>In order to get to these end goals, the plan was to do the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>figure out what would be the basis for animation usage
                        <ul>
                            <li>(e.g. would it be based on size of the object moving, voice and tone guidelines, importance of the object being animated, etc.)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>what the actual animations would be
                        <ul>
                            <li>(e.g. time-wise, curves, where motion should be used etc.)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>create examples of motion in use</li>
                    <li>write first draft of guidelines</li>
                    <li>create low-motion variations of animations</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Throughout this process, I reviewed and revised my work with the rest of the team through actively asking for feedback, standups every 2 days, weekly &quot;office hours&quot; with teams other than the design team, and bi-weekly demos.</p>

        <!-- INSPIRATION -->
        <section>
            <h1>Searching for Inspiration</h1>
            <p>Looking ahead, I wanted to f</p>

            <p>Because motion can add emotions, it was important to me that the emotions shown would properly reflect the voice and tone guidelines written by Charter.</p>

            <p><img of the guidelines></p>

            <p>I found that sometimes emotions were hard to express in words and took a lot of time to describe the types of animations that evoked particular emotions. As a result, I chose to find examples of animations</p>

            <p>Looked at dribbble</p>
            <div class="imgwrap"><img src="../img/spectrum/drb.gif"></div>
            <p>presented the people to see their thoughts</p>
        </section>

        <!-- MOTION START -->
        <section>
            <h1>Creating Examples of Motion</h1>
            <div class="imgwrap"><img src="../img/spectrum/basic_ex.gif"></div>
            <p>I chose to use moving circles to show what each motion curve looked like in terms of translation.</p>

            <p>Using HTML and CSS, I created a basic site with a similar set up to other Kite guideline pages to make it easier to integrate into existing Kite documentation site if need be.</p>

            <p>The site was split up based on corresponding appropriate and inappropriate voice and tones. For example, &quot;friendly&quot; would be across from &quot;chummy&quot;.</p>

            <p>Hovering over each ball would cause the ball to move a set distance. If I had more time, I would have gone back to have both sets of balls move simultaneously, and constantly move back and forth until the user was no longer hovering on the objects. This way, users would have had more time analyze the difference in motion; however, because this was solely for demonstration purposes I opted to not delve deeper into this.</p>

            <h2>Another round of revisions</h2>
            <p>After presenting the curves and asking for opinions, the following were the main points of critique:
                <ol>
                    <li>the motions depicting the unsuitable voice/tone could be pushed to further extremes to allow for better understanding of why it was an inappropriate use of motion</li>
                    <li>describing why each curve was appropriate for describing that voice/tone</li>
                    <li>describing the difference between the two curves</li>
                </ol></p>

            <p>Responding to critiques I addressed the previously mentioned points by doing the following:</p>

            <p>To push limits of the unfitting motions, I pushed the bezier curves to sharper changes in acceleration to exaggerate what they were trying to convey.</p>

            <p>I also wrote descriptions below each set of circles to describe why each curve was appropriate, and the difference between the two curves.</p>

        <!-- NARROWING CURVES -->
        <section>
            <h1>Narrowing Down the Number of Curves</h1>
            <p>Although I had created a set of 8 curves reasonable to have a set of 8 different curves to use because that would probably decrease the cohesive look of platforms if there were so many discrete animations happening all at once.</p>

            <p>I chose to decrease the number of curves. Final curves were chosen based on the similarity of voice/tone they conveyed</p>

            <p>Now that I had finalized all the curves, I wanted to show off the curves in a more concrete setting than with circles.</p>
